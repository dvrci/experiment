          <h2>About the project</h2>
          <p>
            The pattern library is a project spearheaded by a group of 7 UX designers. It also includes 4 frontend developers and is voluntary, meaning all members work on Pattern Library topics additionally to their day to day work.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim is to unify the UI across a many teams and product areas (there are 300 people working in the area product and technology alone).

          <h2>Aim</h2>
          <p>
            The topic Feedback Elements came up whilst working on another project where I wanted to use toasts. These however were not yet defined, and it turned out feedback elements generally varied greatly in design and functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim was to unify all feedback elements, define behaviour and most importantly find a solution that fits so many teams and such a huge product. To tackle this I worked with another fellow UX designer for approximately 4 months.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <div>
          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>
            We started right at the beginning: defining feedback elements and deciding which current elements belong in the category. For this we did a competitor analysis and ask our team what their definition was.
            We decided on Inline banners, system banners, toasts, modals, in-context-popups and tooltips.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next step was to collect the status quo, which we did by asking all UX designers to collect all feedback elements from their area. The frontend devs helped, as some scenarios were hard to recreate and many were hidden.
          </p>
          <p>
            After collecting them we resorted all elements into the six categories mentioned above, which gave us a good idea what we were working with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next we spent a lot of time defining the behaviour of each elements, when should we use what? For example: are toasts a good method for showing error messages (probably not), should we animate the system banners to make them more visible
            and should they disappear on their own or should they be actively be clicked away by the user?
          </p>
          <p>
            This information was hard to make digestible for the Style guide, so I designed an infographic that should help the UX team decide when to use which element.
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source srcset="img/feedback_elements/PROJECTS_fe_infogp1_1x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
            <img class="grey-border"src="img/feedback_elements/PROJECTS_fe_infogp1_2x.jpg" alt="feedback elements infographic">
          </picture>
          <p>
            Once this had been defined, we started the design phase. Going back to the competitor analysis we came up with several concepts that can be roughly categorized into pastell, full colour and white with a splash of colour.
          </p>

        </div>
      </section>

      <div>
        <p>
          To come to a decision we tested each design on a variety of pages. They not only had to fit different scenarios but also be visible on different colour backgrounds and layouts. After all, 25 UX designers across 12 different teams had to use
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We decided on two designs: full colour and white (with the inline banners also being full colour, as we were concerned about visibility). We then presented to the UX team and put it to a vote. The white design won, but there was feedback
          that the full colour inline banner would be too aggressive in the checkout process. Others were concerned that the white design would not be visible as an inline banner without animation.
        </p>
      </div>

      <section>
        <div>
          <h2>Testing</h2>
          <p>
            So we tested! As we were testing visibility and perception, we wanted to expand our usual group of 5 testers to 15, so we could have quantitative and qualitative feedback. We did this as a xmas insights lounge inviting idealo newbies to
            do
            a quick user test and celebrate christmas with sweets and Glühwein.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <div>
          <h2>Prototype</h2>
          <p>
            To test animation I built the prototype with Principle. This worked, but tools such as Axure would have been easier for the user tests.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <div>
          <h2>Ideation</h2>
          <p>
            The results were surprising proving once again that testing is paramount. The white designs had more positive associations and were perceived as subtle. Users, upon asking, said they were concerned about visibility. But the test showed
            the
            designs, including the inline banners, were seen at each touchpoint (users didn’t know what we were testing and were given a task to complete).
          </p>
          <p>
            The full coloured designs were also seen, but not as easily readable (white on full colour was hard to read). They were also perceived as aggressive and 3 testers thought they were being shown advertising, clicking the them away before
            reading the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using the results we amended the white designs to include a white inline banner. The tests also helped to get the backing of the team on the decision made.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section>
        <div>
          <h2>Specs</h2>
          <p>
            As a final task we prepared the specs for the style guide, which brought its own set of challenges. This was the first project where animation was defined as part of a new element, how to show this in a sketch cloud file that doesn't
            allow
            gifs or animation?
            We asked our frontend devs to explain what information they need, so each team can build the same animation. We decided to include this information as code snippets in the design system style guide (a project that had just started). For
            the
            designers, we created a folder with animation examples.
