      <h2>About the project</h2>

      <div>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          The initial idea was to create a specialized shopping list app with better functionalities than those already on the market. User research quickly showed that few users saw a need for this and most used a single app for different types of
          lists. An abundance of both specialized shopping list apps and simple list apps were found, but none that offered users specialized features according to the type of list being created.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The insights gained through user research created an opportunity to fill a gap in the market. So s.lyst was created: a responsive web app with bespoke features for any type of list, from shopping lists, to to-do lists and even reminders.
        </p>

      <h2>Approach</h2>

      <div>
        <h3>The Market</h3>
        <p>
          Compiling a detailed competitor analysis and content audit helped create an understanding for the current market, and most importantly identified the gaps that needed to be filled.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was found that most shopping list apps have been around for several years. While this gives them an advantage in adoption rate, the usability is often clumsy and the UI outdated. There are some great list apps on the market that allow
          users to quickly add and tick off items from a list. These are often very simple and therefore lack features for more specialized uses. It was also found that adding friends on the collaboration features is often too complicated.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>User Research</h2>

      <p>
        It was difficult to find participants who already use a specific shopping list app. Most people who were approached either used the notes app preinstalled on their phone or a general list app. This was the first clue to the insight that
        creating a specialized shopping list app may not be the right way to go. The approach was subsequently amended to determine whether this assumption was true.
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Survey</h3>
        <p>
          Carrying out a survey helped to quantify which features were most important to users: easy collaboration, seamless use on various devices, and the ability to determine the order in which lists are displayed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          Interviewing three potential users provided an in-depth understanding of users’ needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found that interviewers had difficulties persuading others to download the app in order to collaborate; friends were inconvenienced by the setup and concerned about using extra storage space on their phones. > This setback was solved by
          creating a responsive web app. Participants didn’t prioritize being able to individualize their experience, since it was only functional, but did value good visual design. Profile pictures of collaborators was considered crucial to identify
          at a glance who has added a note, who changed a list, etc. Uploading an image to an item was considered more important on reminder- and to-do lists than on shopping lists.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>User Personas</h3>
        <p>
          Creating user personas ensured a visualization throughout the design process of who this app was being created for.
        </p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Task Model</h3>
        <p>
          The task model offered a deep insight into the decision-making process of the user, and helped to understand how s.lyst can support each step. The task model maps out the cycle from complex evaluation, to controlled evaluation, and finally
          direct connection, though it is probable that users will go through the first two cycles several times. This should not be seen as a linear process. Keeping this in mind, it became clear that s.lyst required a flexible structure so that
          users can easily switch to different areas of the app to fulfil their individual needs in each evaluation cycle.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Experience Map</h3>
        <p>
          By mapping out a user’s entire experience, problem areas were highlighted and visualized. Listing touch points that a user may have when using s.lyst further helped to understand their needs. The most valuable outcome of this exercise,
          however, was an in-depth evaluation of the users’ emotions during each step.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information Architecture</h2>

      <div>
        <h3>Open Card Sort</h3>
        <p>
          Conducting an open card sort gave insight into how users would logically group and categorize information. Even though the participants at first seemed overwhelmed, they all grouped the cards in a similar way. The small features were placed
          in different subcategories, but the main tiers and structure were the same.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Sitemap</h3>
        <p>
          Creating a sitemap established a page hierarchy and visual map of s.lyst. The visualization of relations between all pages and content could be used as a point of reference while designing wireframes and prototypes.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>First Designs</h2>

      <div>
        <h3>Paper Prototypes</h3>
        <p>
          Paper prototypes were tested with three users who clicked through digital prototypes. The main finding was that users had difficulties interpreting the meaning of icons. The screen order was then improved and all additional features placed
          in a Vertical ellipsis menu, which gave more space to add text to each icon. Using a swipe functionality on the items further tidied up the interface and rendered icons for “delete” and “edit” obsolete.
        </p>

        </picture>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          Further testing was done using wireframes. Six in-person tests were conducted with wireframes for all devices. The general feedback was very positive: the users were able to complete all tasks and enjoyed the experience. Small, but very
          valuable changes were then made. For example, users expected to land in the new list after creating it rather than seeing the new list added in the overview. This was amended.
          Users had difficulties adding the items using the keyboard. This was corrected by adding large tick icons in the next iteration.
